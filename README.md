# nfl_passing
A personal project analyzing NFL passing stats over time

I started by looking at the earliest data set, 1996. I cleaned up the variable names and deleted several unneeded variables. I've loaded in every year 1996 - 2020 and cleaned up each data set. I combined the data sets and made a nice boxplot with ggplot. Looks good for now, but could try to improve the viz.

I found some useful info online about how to make code chunks scrollable using CSS. I've done this with the chunk loading in and cleaning each yearly data set - pretty neat!
