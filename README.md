A personal project analyzing NFL passing stats over time

I started by looking at the earliest data set, 1996. I cleaned up the variable names and deleted several unneeded variables. I've loaded in every year 1996 - 2020 and cleaned up each data set. I combined the data sets and made a nice boxplot with ggplot. Looks good for now, but could try to improve the viz.

I found some useful info online about how to make code chunks scrollable using CSS. I've done this with the chunk loading in and cleaning each yearly data set - pretty neat!

For final output, I'm thinking I can make a page on my personal website. Within that page, I can have the full write-up but also a dashboard showing the boxplots, and a couple of tables with median QBs in various seasons and top performances over median.

I can also plan to perform some sort of hypothesis test. I'm thinking a proportion test for proportion of QBs over 4,000 yards in a season as a critique of how difficult that is now compared to in the past. I can then propose comparing QBs to their performance over median in that season.
